<!-- The debug parameter causes the scorer to report any errors it
encounters back to the test submittor.  This ensures that if there are
any problems with your test, you will see them when you test it out.
If you remove it, only fatal errors will be reported.
To get a more detailed report about your test, change the parameter name from
debug to verify and then submit an instance of your test with all of the
checkboxes selected.
This will give a report regardless of whether there are problems or not, so
after fixing any problems that show up, remove the verify parameter. -->
